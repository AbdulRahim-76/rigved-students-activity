            The word anime — pronounced "ah-knee-may" — is an abbreviation of the word animation. In
            Japan, the word is used to refer to all animation. However, outside of Japan, it has become
            the catch-all term for animation from Japan.

            For decades, anime was produced by and for Japan — a local product, with a distinct
            look-and-feel to not just the artwork but the storytelling, the themes, and the concepts.
            Over the last forty years, it has become an international phenomenon, attracting millions of
            fans and being translated into many languages. A whole generation of viewers in the West has
            grown up with it and are now passing it on to their own children.

            Because all things anime tend to be lumped together, it's tempting to think of anime as a
            genre. It isn't, at least no more than animation itself is a genre, but rather a description
            of how the material is produced. Anime shows, like books or movies, fall into any number of
            existing genres: comedy, drama, sci-fi, action-adventure, horror and so on

            In the 1980s, anime became mainstream in Japan, experiencing a boom in production with the
            rise in popularity of anime like Gundam, Macross, Dragon Ball, and genres such as real
            robot, space opera and cyberpunk. Space Battleship Yamato and The Super Dimension Fortress
            Macross also achieved worldwide success after being adapted respectively as Star Blazers and
            Robotech.

            The film Akira set records in 1988 for the production costs of an anime film and went on to
            become an international success. Later, in 2004, the same creators produced Steamboy, which
            took over as the most expensive anime film. Spirited Away shared the first prize at the 2002
            Berlin Film Festival and won the 2003 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, while
            Innocence: Ghost in the Shell was featured at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.
